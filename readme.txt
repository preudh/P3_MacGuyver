MacGyver Escape Game

Welcome to the MacGyver Escape Game, inspired by the legendary Richard Dean Anderson character, MacGyver. In this game, you are trapped in a 2D labyrinth where your goal is to assemble materials scattered around the maze to create a syringe and put the guard, who has a hairstyle rivaling that of Tina Turner, to sleep, thus securing your escape.
Features

    Single Level Gameplay: The game consists of one challenging level with the structure (start, wall locations, and exit) easily modifiable through a file.
    Keyboard Controls: Use the directional keys to control MacGyver's movements throughout the maze.
    Random Object Placement: Every time you restart the game, the objects (a needle, a small plastic tube, and ether) are randomly scattered throughout the maze to keep the gameplay fresh and challenging.
    Window Size: The game window is square, accommodating a grid of 15x15 sprites.
    Item Collection: Navigate MacGyver to move over an item to collect it. Collect all items to create a syringe.
    Winning Condition: To win, collect all items to make a syringe and find the maze's exit. Without all the items, approaching the guard will result in MacGyver's death.
    Standalone Program: The game is standalone, meaning it can run on any computer without any additional requirements.
